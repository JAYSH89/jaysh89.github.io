Software Engineer based in Rotterdam, currently Android developer and Kotlin enthusiast!

I began my journey in tech by building websites in Adobe Dreamweaver and creating text-based RPG's in visual basic in middle school. My passion for mobile development ignited with the release of Xcode was made available to the public, leading into a position as iOS engineer.

To quench my thirst for knowledge, I pursued a Master's Degree in Computer Science at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. Post-graduation, I rejoined my previous team as an Android developer where I discovered my passion for Kotlin, Android Development, Jetpack Compose and recently Kotlin Multiplatform. In my leisure time I enjoy exploring iOS development with Swift and Spring Boot (*using Kotlin of course!* :))

Through this 'personal' blog I aim to share my experiences, learnings or other interesting aspects from my professional and personal endeavors in software development.
